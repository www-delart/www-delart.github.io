It was based on reference to an old drawing and descriptions of crates and barrels, carts, and methods of storing and transporting goods.</p><p><img src=/img/publishing/Piro/Illustration_harbour.jpg alt="sample image"></p><p>Similarly, on the basis of literary sources, and the search for analogical references, and above all, based on the contemporary condition of historical sites, other illustrations used in the book were created. These illustrations were made on a scale that allows them to be used in presentations showing the effect of the author&rsquo;s research findings.</p><p><img src=/img/publishing/Piro/x2_drawings_Ontario_settlers.jpg alt="sample image"></p><blockquote><p>Besides the main illustration of Jordan Harbour Port, the trading post on Palatine Hill was portrayed as a vivid hub of great significance gathering all forms of economic activities and entrepreneurship, as well as the place of coexistence, cooperation and meetings of all local communities.
Another meaningful depiction was given to the work of pioneer settlers carrying out the titanic work of one or several families to create a settlement that would provide the basis for survival within one or a couple of seasons.</p></blockquote><h3 id=pre-press-and-remastering>Pre-press and remastering</h3><p>Preparing the materials provided to illustrate a book for printing is another area of editorial work. In addition to the selection and choice of placement, scale, and method of use, many, if not most visuals require cleaning up, cropping, or even rearranging or supplementing elements.</p><p><img src=/img/publishing/Piro/x2_map.jpg alt="sample image"></p><p>Most of the source materials provided are illustrations in digital formats, usually in RGB color space. Many of them are in resolution insufficient for use at the appropriate scale in offset printing. This brings the necessity of additional quality improvement measures, ensuring the use and correct reproduction in print.</p><p><img src=/img/publishing/Piro/x2_Simco_portrait.jpg alt="sample image"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://del-art.ca/js/jquery.min.js></script>
