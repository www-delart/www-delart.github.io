         <h1>CD Covers, Labels, Packaging</h1>
         <p>Projects for digital and music publishing to a large extent rely on maintaining a high level of branding consistency and color uniformity of publications made for one product in many media. The designed layout is printed in the offset, screenprinting, pad-printing, or in the digital printing technique. Very often the customer is willing to take advantage of the possibilities offered by the mirror surface of the CD. Often the packaging is made with the use of additional refining techniques. Custom creative folding and die-cutting can be used to create a unique product.</p>

<p><img src="/img/publishing/packaging/CD_label_1.jpg" alt="sample image" /></p>

<p>Long-term cooperation with publishers allows for a creative approach to commissioned works, as well as for experiments with the methods and techniques used in long-term publishing projects.</p>

<p><img src="/img/publishing/packaging/CD_label_2.jpg" alt="sample image" /></p>

<p>The design work concerns covers, packaging, CD labels, splash screens. For the series of publications developed through seasons and years, the composition layout includes fixed elements or patterns, and elements that can be changed as variants or specific themes.</p>

<p>The animation below shows different parts or different layers of design and preparation for a print. There is a content part, that can be changed or updated quite often, and there is a visual background. It can be also divided into the content and technical part of a project. Usually, there is also division to vector and bitmap kind of graphic.</p>

<p>Another feature of the work for publishing companies may be the cooperation with other visual artists, photographers, illustrators. That is the nature of extended projects.</p>

<h3 id="individual-cd-release">Individual CD release</h3>

<p>CD publishing with audio or data or multimedia content is often the commemorative release or the addition to the book. In those cases, the design is driven by visuals supplied or used in the main event or previously published.</p>

<p>Presented are the set of layouts for the CD imprint and the CD case front and back covers. CD was printed with 2 colors used only: gold and white. The motive used was genuine handwriting. For the cover, the well-known photograph was selected, with its grainy surface and sepia color. Taken together, the effect is very attractive and convincing.</p>

<p>Below are the CD label and CD case cover for the multimedia publication accompanying the scientific book presenting the results of archaeological research.</p>
