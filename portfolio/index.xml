At the end of a day all is taken into consideration in the design process that brings nice outcome and mutual satisfaction.

The alternative developments are included in the final proposition as subtle polishes, rectified character, and hints and notions of additional meaning.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Painting</title><link>https://del-art.ca/portfolio/painting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 18:25:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://del-art.ca/portfolio/painting/</guid><description>&lt;p>My painting is usually executed in oil or acrylic, and painting sketches in watercolor or temper (acrylic temper). As my biggest interest is in visual perception, I lean towards impressionist, post-impressionist, but generally, realistic art, though I am very inspired by the subjective, individualistic, and expressionistic approach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Promotional materials</title><link>https://del-art.ca/portfolio/ts_promo/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 18:25:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://del-art.ca/portfolio/ts_promo/</guid><description>&lt;p>Low-budget projects implemented for the needs of current and annual events.

The sketchiness of the drawing is not a bad feature. As the art is not a higher level of a craft, the photographic feature of the image is not paramount to the drawing study or a picture.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Polly of Bridgewater Farm</title><link>https://del-art.ca/portfolio/polly/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 18:25:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://del-art.ca/portfolio/polly/</guid><description>&lt;p>Publishing project including the design of the book&amp;rsquo;s layout, selection of materials, preparation of illustrations, editorial makeup, author&amp;rsquo;s supervision of the printing process, and also subsequently accompanying promotional activities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The work on publishing this book was extremely fast and intense. At the same time, my wife and I worked on the general publishing concept, we designed the layout of the pages, the cover, selected the illustrations, and prepared them for printing. At the author&amp;rsquo;s request, we conducted research on references to illustrations that were essential and necessary for the content of the book.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
