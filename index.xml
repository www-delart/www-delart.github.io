      <description>&lt;p&gt;Drawing for me is the analytical part of creative work, it is a record of the process of thoughts. The sketchiness of the drawing is not a bad feature. As the art is not a higher level of a craft, the photographic feature of the image is not paramount to the drawing study or a picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The technical conditions and requirements have always been a feature that I research to be in control, to understand, and to challenge the limitations in undertaken projects, to exceed the boundaries of tools, technological solutions, and known standards.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My painting is usually executed in oil or acrylic, and painting sketches in watercolor or temper (acrylic temper). As my biggest interest is in visual perception, I lean towards impressionist, post-impressionist, but generally, realistic art, though I am very inspired by the subjective, individualistic, and expressionistic approach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was quite surprised to learn 3D video editing methods by converting source footage using depth maps. But in fact, it became obvious that this method is effective and, above all, gives great control over the editing process as perfecting the visual storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Projects for digital and music publishing to a large extent rely on maintaining a high level of branding consistency and color uniformity of publications made for one product in many media. The designed layout is printed in the offset, screenprinting, pad-printing, or in the digital printing technique. Very often the customer is willing to take advantage of the possibilities offered by the mirror surface of the CD. Often the packaging is made with the use of additional refining techniques. Custom creative folding and die-cutting can be used to create a unique product.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Optical illusion is a meaningful manifestation of our perception, illustration of most basic phenomena. It is the opening of our thought on the proces of development, and consequently enabling deep reflection on cognitive abilities and worldview foundations. Visual perception is the source and opportunity to develop and work on experiences that are very close, intimate, and subjective, easily accessible to our reflection, and at the same time those are sensations common and available for everybody interested.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The book covers were prominent work from the beginning of creating a design studio, made mostly for the one publishing house growing from producing one title in a couple of months to few new books in a week. Together with my wife, we have designed more than 300 covers just for the biggest customer and the next couple of hundred for other publishers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
