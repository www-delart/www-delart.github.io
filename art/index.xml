The sketchiness of the drawing is not a bad feature. As the art is not a higher level of a craft, the photographic feature of the image is not paramount to the drawing study or a picture.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cross-eye Stereoscopy</title><link>https://del-art.ca/art/3d_crossey/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 18:25:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://del-art.ca/art/3d_crossey/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cross-eyed stereoscopic imagery is the simplest technique to experience the esthetic of the spatial perception.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Painting</title><link>https://del-art.ca/art/painting/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 18:25:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://del-art.ca/art/painting/</guid><description>&lt;p>My painting is usually executed in oil or acrylic, and painting sketches in watercolor or temper (acrylic temper). As my biggest interest is in visual perception, I lean towards impressionist, post-impressionist, but generally, realistic art, though I am very inspired by the subjective, individualistic, and expressionistic approach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Z-Depth based Steroscopy</title><link>https://del-art.ca/art/3d_z-depth_hood/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Nov 2016 18:25:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://del-art.ca/art/3d_z-depth_hood/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I was quite surprised to learn 3D video editing methods by converting source footage using depth maps. But in fact, it became obvious that this method is effective and, above all, gives great control over the editing process as perfecting the visual storytelling.&lt;/p>

It is the opening of our thought on the proces of development, and consequently enabling deep reflection on cognitive abilities and worldview foundations. Visual perception is the source and opportunity to develop and work on experiences that are very close, intimate, and subjective, easily accessible to our reflection, and at the same time those are sensations common and available for everybody interested.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
