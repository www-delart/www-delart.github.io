Optical illusion is a meaningful manifestation of our perception, illustration of most basic phenomena. It is the opening of our thought on the proces of development, and consequently enabling deep reflection on cognitive abilities and worldview foundations. Visual perception is the source and opportunity to develop and work on experiences that are very close, intimate, and subjective, easily accessible to our reflection, and at the same time those are sensations common and available for everybody interested.

Visual phenomena are also a popular art topic. In my case, the focus is on perceptual prodigies that outline the boundries and bendings of our basic source of information - our eyes. I am not attracted to common examples of duality or inconsistency in visual information. My interest is in reflections on the borderline perceptions that require the question of the basis of visual cognition.

I have been an Art Director for the dermatological branch of a prominent pharmaceutical company. The marketing accepted my concept of optically active patterns as a leading theme for their campaigns.

The pop-up trade show booths were designed using patterns displaying apparent motion illusions. The effect was boosted by applying the LED lightning with programmable controllers. The sequences of light color change actively modify the illusory interaction of the patterns.

The material used was a backlight panel printed and processed in a way enabling front and backlighting for rendering captivating and quite unexpected effects for guests visiting a trade show.

Additionally to pop-up displays, for complete choreography there were used:

1. LED full spectrum back and front stage lamps
2. LED lighting panels
3. Gobo lighting
4. Projectors
5. LED screens incorporated in pop-up walls
6. Programmable controllers

> The pop-up trade show arrangements were modular and designed for versatile usage from up to 1000 square feet to optional minimal space allowance, like a rostrum/counter with an 8-foot curve pop-up or a roll-up. Work for this customer included research and scouting on European's trade shows for state of art technologies. The accepted solutions were used in long-term campaigns spreading at least a year period.
