The work on publishing this book was extremely fast and intense. At the same time, my wife and I worked on the general publishing concept, we designed the layout of the pages, the cover, selected the illustrations, and prepared them for printing. At the author's request, we conducted research on references to illustrations that were essential and necessary for the content of the book.

A stunning description of a journey on a stagecoach, in an unbelievable way, because no one now, (at least not me) would have imagined that at that time a large group of passengers traveled on the roof of the stagecoach, often in pouring rain.
