Publishing project including the design of the book's layout, selection of materials, preparation of illustrations, editorial makeup, author's supervision of the printing process, and also subsequently accompanying promotional activities.

The work on publishing this book was extremely fast and intense. At the same time, my wife and I worked on the general publishing concept, we designed the layout of the pages, the cover, selected the illustrations, and prepared them for printing. At the author's request, we conducted research on references to illustrations that were essential and necessary for the content of the book.

_Illustrations devoted to the tragic situation during the famine_

Many facts can be discovered in documents, pamphlets, newspapers from Ireland plunged in tragic circumstances of the famine disaster. Not easy is to find the images depicting this time.

A stunning description of a journey on a stagecoach, in an unbelievable way, because no one now, (at least not me) would have imagined that at that time a large group of passengers traveled on the roof of the stagecoach, often in pouring rain.
